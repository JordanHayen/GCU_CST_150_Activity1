This project meets all of the requirements for Activity1 as outlined in the rubric and in the announcement pertaining to Activity1. This project could not have been created without Visual Studio and the .NET Framework, both of which are installed on my computer. The GUI in this program contains twenty-four controls, including four buttons, twelve labels and  eight textboxes. The controls do "something" as mandated in the announcement; the program functions as a calculator, taking input from the textboxes, parsing them into numeric data types and performing a mathematical operation when one of the buttons is clicked, and displaying the result using the labels.
